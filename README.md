<<<< Self-Consistent Potential Correction Method >>>>

  Supercell models are often used to calculate the electronic 
  structure of local perturbations from the ideal periodicity 
  in the bulk or on the surface of a crystal or in wires. When 
  the defect or adsorbent is charged, a jellium counter charge 
  is applied to maintain overall neutrality, but the interaction 
  of the artificially repeated charges has to be corrected, both 
  in the total energy and in the one-electron eigenvalues and 
  eigenstates. This becomes paramount in slab or wire calculations, 
  where the jellium counter charge may induce spurious states in 
  the vacuum. We present here a self-consistent potential correction 
  scheme and provide successful tests of it for bulk and slab 
  calculations.
